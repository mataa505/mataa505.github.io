        <p>KEVIN DE BRUYNE AND THE JOURNEY TO PERFECTING MIDFIELD SIMPLICITY<br>凯文与他的简单完美中场之路<br><img src="https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guardiola-redmond-960x640.jpg" alt="guagua"></p>
<p><a href="https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/guardiola-redmond-960x640.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guagua</a><br>LEONARDO DA VINCI ONCE SAID, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.” Life is full of complexities, yet success often derives from the simplest of acts. For Kevin De Bruyne, that simple act was scoring a goal. One that meant more than just success to him, it was an ebullient moment of vindication.</p>
<h1 id="简单是最高级的复杂，达文西曾这么说。生活充满了复杂性，然而成功通常来自最简单的行动。对于凯文来说，最简单的行动就是进球。这不仅仅是代表成功，更是热烈的拥护。"><a href="#简单是最高级的复杂，达文西曾这么说。生活充满了复杂性，然而成功通常来自最简单的行动。对于凯文来说，最简单的行动就是进球。这不仅仅是代表成功，更是热烈的拥护。" class="headerlink" title="简单是最高级的复杂，达文西曾这么说。生活充满了复杂性，然而成功通常来自最简单的行动。对于凯文来说，最简单的行动就是进球。这不仅仅是代表成功，更是热烈的拥护。"></a>简单是最高级的复杂，达文西曾这么说。生活充满了复杂性，然而成功通常来自最简单的行动。对于凯文来说，最简单的行动就是进球。这不仅仅是代表成功，更是热烈的拥护。</h1><p>Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City had all but battered Chelsea into submission, yet the game remained scoreless. Last year, it would have been typical of the side to fall short in their search for supremacy, failing to break the deadlock or worse still, gifting the opposition an undeserved winner through a momentary lapse in defensive concentration. This season, however, was different.</p>
<h2 id="瓜的曼城几乎让切尔西黯然失色，然而这场比赛却没有进球。如果是去年，这会是一场经典的争霸赛事，无法打破的僵局、或是更糟的因为一个防守失误让对手获得了不应得的胜利。但是今年不同。"><a href="#瓜的曼城几乎让切尔西黯然失色，然而这场比赛却没有进球。如果是去年，这会是一场经典的争霸赛事，无法打破的僵局、或是更糟的因为一个防守失误让对手获得了不应得的胜利。但是今年不同。" class="headerlink" title="瓜的曼城几乎让切尔西黯然失色，然而这场比赛却没有进球。如果是去年，这会是一场经典的争霸赛事，无法打破的僵局、或是更糟的因为一个防守失误让对手获得了不应得的胜利。但是今年不同。"></a>瓜的曼城几乎让切尔西黯然失色，然而这场比赛却没有进球。如果是去年，这会是一场经典的争霸赛事，无法打破的僵局、或是更糟的因为一个防守失误让对手获得了不应得的胜利。但是今年不同。</h2><ul>
<li>Receiving the ball on the half-turn, De Bruyne adjusted his body shape to play a vertical pass into the feet of Gabriel Jesus. The Brazilian striker immediately returned the favour, laying it back to him before the Belgian drove forwards, taking the game by the scruff of the neck, and rifled his left-footed shot across goal to score the eventual winner.</li>
<li>凯文在半场的时候接到了球，调整身体角度完美的垂直传球给了热稣斯的脚下。这名巴西前锋立即回报了这个恩惠，把球接下后再回传给这位向前奔跑的比利时球员，他用上半身停了球，并用左脚射门并最终得到了进球。<br>The strike bore individual significance to De Bruyne for two reasons, starting with the man his shot flew past, Thibaut Courtois. The pair had been great friends growing up together, playing for both Genk and the Belgium national side. But their relationship soured rapidly when De Bruyne discovered his girlfriend at the time had been unfaithful to him, with none other than Courtois.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>这个破门对凯文有着很深的个人意义，其中一个理由是这球穿过了守门员库尔图瓦的防守，他们本是好朋友，一起长大并同样为 Genk 与比利时国家队效力。但是当凯文发现他的女友劈腿库尔图瓦后，他们的关系迅速恶化。</li>
<li>The second reason was the club, Chelsea. The Blues had given De Bruyne his first taste of English football back in 2012, signing him alongside compatriot Courtois in a deal worth around £7 million. It was no surprise, really – his mother had family in England and a young Kevin spent a lot of his youth visiting their home in the London borough of Ealing, just a short drive from Stamford Bridge. The transfer should have been the midfielder’s big break.<br>另一个理由是切尔西具乐部。2012年切尔西给了德布劳内他在英超初试啼声的机会，当时与库尔图瓦一起加入共花了车子 7百万英镑。这一点也不奇怪，凯文他的母亲在英国有亲戚，当他年轻的时候凯文时常拜访在伦敦的亲戚家，这地方离切尔西主场只要几分钟车程。这个转会应成为这名中场的大突破。<br>Alas, the agony of infidelity weighed heavy on De Bruyne’s heart. It had affected his focus, work-rate, and drive. What he needed was an arm around the shoulder, a father figure of a coach to help him through this emotional rut. Unfortunately, no such olive branch was extended.<br>唉，然而被劈腿的苦楚让这位中场的心思沉重，更影响了他的专注力、工作表现与驾驶技术。这种情况他应该需要一位如同父亲一样的教练来支持他的情绪恢复，然而他并没有得到这样的待遇。<br>Manager José Mourinho was confident in De Bruyne’s abilities but reserved doubts over his mental strength. The Portuguese tactician is a born winner and has never suffered fools gladly. What ensued was an ugly tit-for-tat that resulted in De Bruyne leaving London after only three league appearances. Mourinho’s parting shot was to label him a “cry baby”, while the Belgian stated things would have been different if he was “a £45 million player”.<br>穆里尼奥对凯文的能力充满信心，但是却对他心理抗压能力存疑。这位葡萄牙导师是天生的赢家，并且从未体因为心情受创而挣扎。接下来凯文得到的是丑陋的针锋相对，在寥寥三次出场后他离开了伦敦。穆里尼奥更是给他贴上了”爱哭的婴儿”这种标签，然而凯文说如果自己是个”四千五百万英镑的球员”，情况就会不同。</li>
</ol>
<p>BELGIAN BEGINNINGS<br>De Bruyne has always been strong in his convictions. This is a player who left boyhood club Drongen aged eight after telling his coach “the training sessions are better at Gent.” Having been born in the Ghent sub-municipality, he spent his formative years carrying a football with him wherever he went. The youngster honed his weaker foot in his back garden at the request of his parents, who were worried about the damage Kevin was inflicting on their plant pots.<br>凯文一直有着坚定的信念。他八岁离开Drongen的时候对着青训教练说＂Gent 的训练课程比较好＂。他出生在Gent 附近的一个卫星城市，他花了整年的时间不论到哪都带着足球练习。这位年轻人根据父母的要求在后院磨练自己的非惯用脚，其实是担心凯文会破坏了后院的盆栽。<br>After representing Drongen for two years, the plucky playmaker moved to regional giants Gent and fast made a name for himself. His youth coaches were unsure – this was a boy with undoubted talent, yet something was unsettling about his forthright nature. Kevin wasn’t so much a rebel, more strong-willed, but either way, they thought it best to iron this trait out of his persona. It did not end well.<br>在代表 Drogen 两年之后，这位勇敢的组织者加入了当地巨人Gent并迅速为自己打响名号。他的青训教练不是很确定–这无疑是位充满天赋的男孩，但是她的直率天性却造成了他人的不安。凯文不是个叛逆者，可他意志坚强，但大人们总觉得应该让他性格服贴点，然而这并没有好的结局。<br>“He just held on to one of the posts and refused to let go. He was in a rage. Three of us tried to pull him away from it but we didn’t manage,” recalled Frank De Leyn, De Bruyne’s old coach. He was reminiscing about a training camp in Barcelona where the adolescent midfielder was reprimanded for failing to help clear away equipment after training. “He was stubborn as hell, like a mule, but I also think that it is that stubbornness, that character trait, that has made him the player he is now.”<br>“他坚持只踢一个位置，拒绝让位。他很愤怒。我们有三个人尝试把他拉开，但没有好好管理。”凯文的老教练佛兰克回忆道。他想起在巴赛罗娜的一个青训营，那个青少年中场并没有帮助整理训练装备，”他有着地狱等级的顽固，就像头骡子，不过我认为就是那种固执的性格特征让他成为现在这种球员。”<br>Inevitably, their personalities clashed. De Bruyne’s self-assurance proving the antithesis to De Leyn’s autocratic discipline. He was one of the brightest talents in Gent’s academy and couldn’t conceive why his coach was so hard on him. News of the player’s discontent travelled the length and breadth of the nation and it wasn’t long before Genk made contact, coaxing their adversary’s starlet.<br>他的人格不可避免的会与人发生冲突。凯文的自信让他站到了教练佛莱克专制纪律主义的对立面，他是Gent里最天赋异禀的一个，却一直不懂为什么教练处处针对他。球员的不满通过媒体广泛的传开来，这就是 Genk 开始接触他前不久，这个竞争队伍的教练就开始哄这位迪对球队的小明星。<br>Moving across the country aged 14 wasn’t an easy decision, but one that De Bruyne made with uncompromised tunnel-vision. He wanted to become a professional footballer more than anything; his drive and obstinacy only further accentuated by others attempts to strip him of them. He swiftly established himself at the fulcrum of Genk’s under-21 side. Often playing out wide, he demonstrated versatility by wreaking havoc from the channels and providing sublime service for the side’s target man, Christian Benteke.<br>搬到国家的另一边对于一个 14岁的少年不是个轻松的决定，不过凯文毫不犹豫与不予人妥协的立即决定，他比什么都还想要成为一位职业足球运动员，他的行动与顽固的特性，使他人更想要磨他的锐气。他迅速成为 Genk U-21的重要一环，他时常发挥出色，在球场各处发挥能力，从旁提供多样的支援了球队的主力本特克。<br>Naturally, he progressed into the first team and made his debut at 17. His first full season of action was a challenging one and Genk even flirted with the idea of relegation. The curve was steep but De Bruyne was a fast learner. In 2010/11 he took the Pro League by storm, scoring five and assisting a further 16, as De Smurfen won their third championship and cemented himself as a vital cog in midfield.<br>自然而然的在他17岁的时候，他进入了一线队并首次亮相。他第一个赛季充满着挑战，Genk 更曾一度落入降级区，赛果起伏不过凯文是个学习很快的球员。在2010/11赛季，他是比利时联赛的风暴，进了五球并完成了16次助攻， De Smurfen (蓝色小精灵)赢得了他们第三个冠军，并浅凯文展现自己在中路的重要性。<br>His dexterous aptitude attracted admiring glances from across Europe and, in January 2012, he signed for Chelsea before seeing out the rest of the season at Genk on loan. Another loan spell followed and this time as De Bruyne packed up his box of tricks and headed for Germany.<br>他灵巧的才能吸引了欧洲各地球队的目光，在2012年一月，他签下了切尔西的租借合同，然后另一个租借紧接其后，他收拾了自己的技术，前往了德国。<br>GERMAN EDUCATION<br>In many ways, his spell at Werder Bremen was the making of the Belgian. Thomas Schaaf, Die Werderaner’s manager, appreciated the talent he had at his disposal and immediately afforded his new signing creative license. His faith was rewarded as De Bruyne shone, helping his new club maintain their Bundesliga status despite their failings to win any of the last 12 league fixtures.<br>各方面来说，云达不来梅的魔咒是这比利时人的成就。布莱梅的教练沙夫对凯文的才能表示赞赏与信任，并毫不犹豫地给他新的合约。沙夫的信任得到凯文的回报，帮助这支球队在德甲的地位，尽管这支球队在最后12场比赛没赢过任何一场。<br>What was so impressive about De Bruyne’s game, alongside the spectacular, was its blissful simplicity. While other advanced players made their name with exuberant skills or astounding goals, the playmaker combined this with the ability to bring out the best in others. Great moves are often initiated by stunning foresight; a line-breaking pass, a perfectly weighted ball, and in De Bruyne, Bremen had their architect.<br>凯文的比赛最令人印象深刻的部分，除了卓越以外，还有其简洁之美。相较于其他球员使用华丽的技术与惊人的射门为自己扬名之时，这位球员有让他人组织在一起并表现更好的能力。一个完美的进攻往往由最惊人的预判发起；一个突破防线的传球、一个完美配重的直塞，在布莱梅凯文是他们的建筑师。<br>He was named Bundesliga Young Player of the Year and racked up an impressive 10 goals and nine assists. Naturally, he headed back to his parent club brimming with confidence only to be let down by external factors, impatience and obduracy. The aforementioned conflict with Mourinho resulted in an £18 million transfer back to German shores, this time with Wolfsburg.<br>他被评选为德甲最佳球员，打入十个进球与九次助攻。当然，他对回到自己的母队满是信心，只有外在因素能打击他，不耐烦与顽固的打击。前述与穆里尼奥的冲突让他以1800万元的价格转会狼堡，德国的海边。<br>De Bruyne was left angry and frustrated at Chelsea – he was clearly a talented individual, but needed to feel loved and wanted. Thankfully, that indignation was ephemeral, as new coach Dieter Hecking made him feel special from day one. He repaid his faith in the only way he knew how – with a myriad of goals and assists.<br>The 2014/15 season marked his best season to date. Die Wölfe finished runners-up to PepGuardiola’s Bayern machine and won the DFB-Pokal. De Bruyne struck 16 times and racked up a sensational 27 assists – 21 in the league alone, a Bundesliga record. He also shone on the European stage. His exquisite volley against Lille helped secure their Europa League group qualification before he netted two goals in the last-16 against Inter Milan.<br>“He is a phenomenon, you can find him everywhere on the pitch, but then he also manages to disappear and emerge at the right time,” Hecking eulogised as he was named Footballer of the Year in Germany. “He is a perfect player when you look at transitions from defence to offence. He has a fantastic anticipation level for empty space and opponents find it incredibly difficult to defend against him.”<br>Indeed, the Belgian was now operating on a level far beyond his peers and keeping him at the club became unfeasible. As a £55 million move to Manchester City materialised, his converted penalty that helped Wolfsburg lift the 2015 DFL-Supercup proved to be De Bruyne’s leaving present to a club that had given him so much.</p>
<p>ENGLISH REDEMPTION</p>
<p>Upon his return to England, he stated: “I want to reach the highest level possible as a player and I think the most important thing is that at the end of the season we can be happy and maybe have some titles.” As always, De Bruyne was determined in his approach and not perturbed by becoming the Premier League’s second most expensive signing ever.<br>He enjoyed a solid start to life in Manchester, although his price tag and history still led some quarters of the media to label him merely a Chelsea flop. However, the longer the season went on, the quieter his critics became, and his season reached its apex in April. Having already helped City secure the League Cup, he scored the winner at the Etihad in the Champions League quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, curling a lovely shot past Kevin Trapp and sending the club through to their first ever semi-final.<br>That summer, De Bruyne teamed up with the man who would transform him from a world-class midfielder, into arguably the world’s best. Pep Guardiola was announced as the new manager and was effusive in his praise of the Belgian. “I think he is a special, outstanding player. He makes everything. Without the ball he is the first fighter, and with the ball he is clear – he sees absolutely everything.”<br>The 2016/17 season was a testing one for the Citizens. Guardiola’s lack of pace at full-back meant De Bruyne was shoehorned into a variety of positions, playing everywhere from centre-forward to wing-back. Despite being used in so many varied roles and systems, though, he still produced a mightily impressive 23 assists. He later admitted that playing all over the pitch gave him a greater appreciation of his teammates’ thinking and movement, strengthening his wavelength with them.<br>With Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo acquired in the summer, the midfielder looked set to assume his customary role. There was just one more event that would put the cherry on the icing on the cake.<br>Belgium had just thrashed Estonia 8-1 to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia but, significantly, it was a game that saw the attacking midfielder play a more withdrawn role. Such was De Bruyne’s impact in this position, Guardiola has decided to utilise him to similar effect this season; a tactical switch which has produced staggering results and prompted Pep to say: “Messi is on a table on his own. No-one else is allowed. But the table beside, Kevin can sit there.”<br>Now 26 years of age and an ineliminable fixture in Guardiola’s ostensibly unconquerable behemoth, De Bruyne is at the peak of his powers. His goal against Chelsea spoke of his nonpareil influence and further performances against Stoke and Arsenal have only solidified his early claims to become PFA Player of the Year.<br>His sublime goals, flashy step-overs and 40-yard passes may make the headlines, but it is his consistent ability to make the football look so simple that makes him special. The bullish, stubborn characteristics remain but they are blended with lovely, almost poetic technique.<br>De Bruyne was once dubbed “the modern Cruyff”’ by his under-21 manager at Genk and, in the words of the great man, himself: “Playing football is very simple, but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is.” When it comes to breaking down football’s complexities, there’s simply no one better </p>
